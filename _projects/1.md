    - review: "A wonderful and very well illustrated book for children. The illustrations and story by this brilliant author show her excellent ability to relate to and capture young minds in her own unique way with a little mystery about Shelly's stocking.  We highly recommend this intriguing children's book. It is a great introduction to your child to the story and reading world!"

    - review: 'The innocence of kids and their way of living in their own small fantasy world is something explored nicely in the book. The story moves ahead in one or two lines at a time while an attractive graphic is there in the background. It makes the book an interesting read.'

Shelly painstakingly makes a stocking from an old bag. The stocking then flies to the town and cannot find its way back. Read the book to know if Shelly’s Stocking returns and if Shelly gets her presents this Christmas.
