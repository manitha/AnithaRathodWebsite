She is a graduate from the Indian Institute of Management - Lucknow [IIM-L] with an MBA degree, specialised in Human Resources and Finance. She worked with corporates for about 9 years.
          <br/><br/> Anitha quit her corporate career to pursue her passion for creating books that bring the joy of reading, give wings to creativity and imagination, and at the same time sensitise today's children on various topics. Writing stories for children gives her immense pleasure and she cherishes the moments when kids enjoy every bit of her stories and sink into the imaginative world.

          <br/><br/>She enjoys writing articles on various topics ranging from entrepreneurship to religious-tolerance. As an illustrator, she continues to bring her characters to life through her lively and colourful illustrations.

          <br/><br/>When she is not writing or illustrating, she loves to spend time with her 2 young kids. She is also a marathon runner and enjoys swimming."

  text: "Reading to kids is my favorite activity as an author and I am always ready for any engagements with the schools. As a self-published author, I have gained tremendous experience in all stages of book creation right from writing a story, getting feedback, editing, composing pictures with right settings, designing the book layout and structure and publishing. I believe my experience can inspire kids to create their own books. 

        <br/><br/>There is no dearth of creativity and imagination in children, all they need is some inspiration and meeting an author can emphasize the idea that they can be artists and writers too, much like the author they meet in person. Author visit provides an immense opportunity for the kids to learn and understand the process of creating books. "
